DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4:

This task focuses on designing a Virtual Reality (VR) inspired interface that creates an immersive and intuitive user experience. I designed a fictional movie browsing application called CineVR, which simulates how users would interact with content inside a 3D VR space.The main highlight of this interface is a 3D movie carousel, where users can explore movie posters using left and right navigation arrows. Each movie card displays tilt effects, glow shadows, and focus transitions that mimic a real-world VR gallery. On selecting a movie, users are taken to a details screen that presents the movie's title, description, and a prominent "Watch Now" button, styled to stand out within the VR context.To enhance realism, I used drop shadows, spacing, and visual scaling techniques. The interface is designed and prototyped in Figma.

Key Features

VR-style Carousel Navigation with intuitive left/right buttons Focus Glow & Shadow Effects to show depth and active selection Movie Info Page with interactive content and call-to-action Immersive 3D Layouts simulating a real VR environment
